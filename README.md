# Repo for 'Global hierarchical models for wind and wave contours'

This is the repository for the paper 'Global hierarchical models for wind and wave contours: Physical interpretations of the dependence functions' by A. F. Haselsteiner, A. Sander, J.-H. Ohlendorf and K.-D. Thoben.

It contains the following things:
 * The used datasets (folder 'datasets')
 * Python files to reproduce the analysis for datasets A, B and C (folder 'python')
 * Matlab files to reproduce the analysis for datasets D, E and F (folder 'matlab')
   * software package exponentiated-weibull (the class ExponentiatedWeibull.m has its own repository, https://github.com/ahaselsteiner/exponentiated-weibull )
   * software package compute-hdc (this package to compute highest density contours has its own repository, https://github.com/ahaselsteiner/compute-hdc)
